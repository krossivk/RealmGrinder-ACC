This is an AutoClicker, Autocaster for RealmGrinder.

Author: Manndadog

You can use it as you want.
The Sourcecode is an AutoIt File. 
See the AutoIt Documentation, if you want to Change it.


You can also see, that there is no harmful code inside!!!!
It's just a loop, which clicks on the spot where the mouse currently is
and sends the number keys for the spells every time, when your mana is completly filled up.
(When Mana == Maximum Mana! Mod max Mana to shorten cast time.)

You have to fill in your Maximum Mana and your mana per sec and start the autocasting, when your mana is at 100%.

Multicasting one spell is not directly possible at the moment...:(
You can enter a lower number for maximum Mana, so the timer hit more often, but it will send all marked keys at that point.

The Hotkey to start the Clicks is the F4-Key.
To start the casts it's the F3-Key.


These key-bindings are defined in the source code, so if u want to change them, you have to install AutoIt and modifiy the lines 14 and 15.
After that, you can compile the Skript into an easy to use exe-file.
As mentioned for examples and help, see the AutoIt Documentation.
The excisting exe-file is compiled out of the sourcecode you can see in the hub.

have fun!!!
